# The Forde Report

The Forde Report is the culmination of an independent investigation commissioned by the Labour Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) in 2020 to investigate both the contents of an internal report leaked into the public domain, as well as the circumstances in which it was prepared and put into the public domain.

The Labour Party published its action plan on the Forde Reporti, and I have collected some assets which are available, 

1.  The Party’s web page [(https)](https://labour.org.uk/fordereport) and a mirror, (.zip) & [(.torrent)](https://dfl.ddns.net/share/labourfordereportwebpage.zip.torrent)
2.  Their spreadsheet responses, i.e. done, in progress, and superseded, these are .pdf and available here as a [(.zip)]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/10BSC7BEASaaUvWjS7uUa9zxZoAxNi2go/view?usp=drive_link) and as a [(.torrent)](https://dfl.ddns.net/share/labourplabforforde.zip.torrent)

3.  On March 23, I made some more uploads, and I have created [a second torrent](https://dfl.ddns.net/share/labourfordereportwebpage-mar23.zip.torrent) mirroring the web page as at the time. 

I copied this index to [an article on my wiki, entitled the Forde Report](https://davelevy.info/wiki/the-forde-report/), this article also contains some comments. It is [bookmarked as #archives](https://davelevy.info/wiki/the-forde-report/#archives)
