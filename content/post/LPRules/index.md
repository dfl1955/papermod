## Meta

This is a simple mirror of https://davelevy.info/wiki/labours-rule-book/
, that page has a bitly alias https://bit.ly/labourrules  and contains documents other than the rules.

Here’s the [2024 rule book [http/pdf]](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rule-Book-2024.pdf), and [my mirror copy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYDbmxuxiG31Q1hYXbDZu59ZIOUdQNwz/view?usp=drive_link). These are the rules as passed by #LAB24.

## The Archive

Here are my copies of the old rules, I posted some of them to the wikipedia, but they decided that they lacked significance because they weren’t cited enough, so wikipedia considers this to be original research

+ [2023 Rules [http/pdf]](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rule-Book-2023-FINAL_web_v3.pdf) and [my mirror copy (.pdf)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FttkasisZ10y7K2D5k4q3b69MqIvRYLl/view?usp=drive_link)
+ [2022 Rule Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gO8V7pzWZ9fE-wUxLVItpVWFsyq9zZ9s/view?usp=sharing), my mirror. 
+ There was no conference and thus no rule changes at the ’20 conference and thus no 2021 Rule Book.
